Marketing Campaign Performance Analysis Using Power BI
1. Project Title

Marketing Campaign Performance Analysis and Visualization using Microsoft Power BI

2. Introduction

In today’s competitive business environment, organizations rely heavily on data-driven insights to evaluate the effectiveness of their marketing strategies. This project focuses on analyzing marketing campaign data using Microsoft Power BI to understand campaign performance, channel efficiency, and return on investment (ROI). The project aims to assist decision-makers in identifying high-performing campaigns and areas requiring improvement.

3. Objective of the Project

The primary objectives of this project are:

To analyze marketing campaign performance across different channels

To evaluate key metrics such as impressions, clicks, conversions, spend, revenue, and ROI

To identify underperforming campaigns

To present insights through interactive dashboards for better decision-making

4. Dataset Description

The project uses multiple datasets related to marketing campaigns:

Marketing_Campaign_50_Rows.xlsx: Contains campaign-level data including impressions, clicks, conversions, spend, revenue, and ROI

Channel_Summary.xlsx: Provides aggregated performance metrics for each marketing channel

Underperforming_Campaigns.xlsx: Highlights campaigns with low ROI and poor performance

These datasets were imported into Power BI for analysis.

5. Tools and Technologies Used

Microsoft Power BI Desktop – Dashboard creation and visualization

Power Query – Data cleaning and transformation (ETL process)

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Calculated measures such as ROI and performance indicators

GitHub – Version control and project repository management

6. Data Processing and Modeling

Data cleaning and transformation were performed using Power Query

Relationships were established between campaign data and channel data

Calculated columns and measures were created using DAX

A structured data model was designed to support efficient analysis

7. Dashboard Design

An interactive Power BI dashboard was created with the following features:

Campaign performance overview

Channel-wise revenue and ROI analysis

Identification of underperforming campaigns

Visuals such as bar charts, pie charts, line charts, and KPI cards

The dashboard enables users to filter and analyze data dynamically.

8. Key Insights

Certain marketing channels generate higher ROI compared to others

Some campaigns incur high spend but yield lower revenue

Underperforming campaigns were identified based on ROI and revenue metrics

Channel-level analysis helps in optimizing marketing budget allocation

9. Conclusion



This project successfully demonstrates how Power BI can be used to analyze and visualize marketing campaign data effectively. By transforming raw data into meaningful insights, the dashboard supports data-driven decision-making and helps organizations improve marketing efficiency and profitability.
